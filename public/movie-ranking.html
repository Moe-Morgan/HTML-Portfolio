<hr />
<h3>The Queens Gambit</h3>
<p>It has an interesting story line and teaches you a little about chess, while still being entertaining</p>

<h3>Lost In Space</h3>
<p>Great graphics and creativity. Takes space travel and ailens to a new level.</p>

<h3>Monk</h3>
<p>Great detective show where it's just a detective noticing small details that are easily missed.</p>
